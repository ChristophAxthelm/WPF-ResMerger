WPF-ResMerger
=============

We all agree that a good styling structure is essential for a successful WPF project. However, while we should certainly stick to the granular structure dividing each type into different resource dictionaries, dependencies between merged dictionaries will grow tremendously. This overhead can slow down the loading time of control heavy views a lot. And exactly this is the reason why we developed a tool which solves this very problem... The ResMerger!
